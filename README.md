# SkriptMultiEval
This script allow you to use multiple codes to evaluate in-game using `/#` command

## Why?
Skript has a built-in evaluate effect but it only evaluate one line code at a time, this script allows you to do multiple `single line` effect at a time.

What is `multiple single line effect`? this script can't do loops and indentions, but it can do this `/# set {_i} ti "Test" -> broadcast {_i}`

## Docs
```
#! Use $me to get the player parsed as a player type (not surrounded by quotation marks "") - ex. (send "%tool of $player%") this will be parsed as (send "%tool of ""SkriptDev"" parsed as offlineplayer%")
#! Use $player to get the player parsed as a player type (when surrounded by quotation marks "") - ex. (give 1 stone to $me) this will be parsed as (give 1 stone to "SkriptDev" parsed as player)

#! Use $name to get the player name parsed as text
#! Use $uuid to get the uuid of player

#! Use $PlayerName$ to get some player parsed as a offlineplayer type (not surrounded by quotation marks "") - ex. (give 1 stone to $SkriptDev$) this will be parsed as (give 1 stone to "SkriptDev" parsed as player)
#! Use $$PlayerName$ to get some player parsed as a offlineplayer type (surrounded by quotation marks "") - ex. (send "%tool of $$SkriptDev$%") this will be parsed as (send "%tool of ""SkriptDev"" parsed as offlineplayer%")

#! Use " -> " without the quotes to use multi lines (Note the spaces around the -> are important) - ex. (set {_i} to "Test" -> broadcast {_i})

#! Command to use this '/#' without quotes to use the function
#! Permission required: 'skript.multieval'
